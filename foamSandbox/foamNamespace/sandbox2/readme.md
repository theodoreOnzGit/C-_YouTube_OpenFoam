## sandbox 2 readme

This is a directory created using 

foamNewApp $applicationName

here i test bits of the C++ code using OpenFOAM's Foam namespace

as well as the various include files


Some functions used to test this are as follows

wmake (compiles)

wclean (removes the dependency files)
rm -rf sandbox2 (removes the executable file)

foamCleanTutorials (removes all time directories except the 0 directory)

i also copied the system/controlDict folder for the needed for the time directory...
